#  2) Though not required, GOPATH is assumed to be the ../../../../../ directory
#  3) The directory on the VM Host will be /vagrant on the VM and be the path in GOPATH
#  4) ProxyFS repo git clone'd to $GOPATH/src/github.com/NVIDIA/
#  5) Swift repos et. al. git clone'd to $GOPATH/src/github.com/NVIDIA/proxyfs/saio/
#  6) ../Makefile will be ready to be executed after `cdpfs` inside the VM
#  7) As GOPATH is effectively shared between Host and VM, builds in the two environments
#     will collide in the contents of the $GOPATH/bin (only executables, not libraries)
