/*

 * The trackedlock packages provides an implementation of sync.Mutex and
 * sync.RWMutex interfaces that provides additional functionality in the form of
 * lock hold tracking.  In addition, the trackedlock.RWMutexTrack routines can
 * be used to track other RWMutex-like synchronization primitives, like
 * dlm.RWLockStruct and chunked put connections.
 *
 * Specifically, if lock tracking is enabled, the trackedlock packages checks
 * the lock hold time.  When a lock unlocked, if it was held longer than
 * "LockHoldTimeLimit" then a warning is logged along with the stack trace of
 * the Lock() and Unlock() of the lock.  In addition, a daemon, the trackedlock
 * watcher, periodically checks to see if any lock has been locked too long.
 * When a lock is held too long, the daemon logs the goroutine ID and the stack
 * trace of the goroutine that acquired the lock.
 *
 * Subsequent versions of this package may include lock heirarchy checking.
 *
 * The config variable "TrackedLock.LockHoldTimeLimit" is the hold time that
 * triggers warning messages being logged.  If it is 0 then locks are not
 * tracked and the overhead of this package is minimal.
 *
 * The config variable "TrackedLock.LockCheckPeriod" is how often the daemon
 * checks tracked locks.  If it is 0 then no daemon is created and lock hold
 * time is checked only when the lock is unlocked (assuming it is unlocked).
 *
 * trackedlock locks can be locked before this package is initialized, but they
 * will not be tracked until the first time they are locked after
 * initializaiton.
 *
 * The API consists of the config based trackedlock.Up() / Down() /
 * PauseAndContract() / ExpandAndResume() (which are not defined here) and then
 * the Mutex, RWMutex, and RWMutexTrack interfaces.
