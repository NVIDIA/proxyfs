# flake8 has opinions with which we agree, for the most part. However,
# flake8 has a plugin mechanism by which other people can add their
# opinions; we do not necessarily like those opinions. In particular,
# "hacking" adds many different checks, a significant number of which
# are completely bogus. Fortunately, they have a convention: hacking
# checks start with "H", so that's what we ignore.
