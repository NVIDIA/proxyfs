# First, play out the whole interaction between n1 and n2. We see n1's probe to
# n2 get rejected (since n2 needs a snapshot); the snapshot is delivered at which
# point n2 switches to the correct config, and n1 catches it up. This notably
# includes the empty conf change which gets committed and applied by both and
# which transitions them out of their joint configuration into the final one (1 2 3).
