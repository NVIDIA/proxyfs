# ProxyFS Release Notes

## 1.9.5 (February 13, 2019)

### Features:

Made StatVfs() responses configurable. Note that values
for space (total, free, available) continue to be set
to artificial values... but at least they are now settable.

### Bug Fixes:

Re-worked logic for various path-based operations (i.e.
operations invoked via Swift or S3 APIs) could result in
a deadlock when combined with file-based operations. These
have now largely been resolved (see Issues section for
details on what is not).

Modified pfsconfjson{|packed} to auto-upgrade supplied
.conf files to report the VolumeGroup-translated form
(if up-conversion would be done by ProxyFS itself).

COALESCE method, when targeted at an existing Object,
would previously fail to recover the overwritten Object's
space.

Various pre-VolumeGroup->VolumeGroup auto-upgrade patterns
could result in false reporting of a Volume being moved to
a VolumeGroup where it already exists in response to SIGHUP.
Just restarting ProxyFS would not see this issue.

### Issues:

While much work was completed towards avoiding deadlock
situations resulting from path-based (i.e. Swift/S3 API)
operations, the work is not yet complete. A GET on a
Container/Bucket that recurses could still result in a
deadlock but the bug fix for this case largely closes
that window. A PUT also has the potential for another
deadlock situation that is equally very unlikely. No test
case has been able to expose these remaining deadlocks
so they remain theoretical.

## 1.9.2 (January 18, 2019)

### Bug Fixes:

Resolved race condition when simultaneous first references to
an `Inode` are executed resulting in a lock blocking any further
access to the `Inode`. This condition was frequently seen when
attempting a multi-part upload via the S3 or Swift HTTP APIs
as it would be typical/expected that the uploading of all the
parts of a new `file` would begin roughly at the same time.

It is now possible to perform builds and unit tests on the
same node where an active ProxyFS session is in operation.
Previously, identical TCP and UDP Ports were being used by
default leading to bind() failures.

### Features:

Updated to leverage Golang 1.11.4 features.

Added support for `X-Object-Sysmeta-Container-Update-Override-Etag`.

Added support for `end-marker` query params.

Added support for fetching a `ReadPlan` for a given file
via the HTTP interface. The `ReadPlan` may then be used to
HEAD or GET the individual `LogSegments` that, when stitched
together, represent the contents of the file.

Liveness monitoring now active among all ProxyFS instances
visable via JSON response to an HTTP Query on the embedded
HTTP Server's Port for `/liveness`.

Added support for VolumeGroups where the set of Volumes in a
VolumeGroup are what is assigned to a Peer/Node rather than
each individual Volume.

## 1.8.0.7 (January 28, 2019)

### Features:

The response to fsstat(1), statfs(2), and statvfs(3) returns
capacities that were hardcoded (e.g. Total Space of 1TiB). While
it is currently not possible for such reporting to represent
actual capacities, new config values are available to adjust the
reported values. In addition, the defaults have been increased
(e.g. Total Space is now reported as 100 TiB).

## 1.8.0.6 (January 23, 2019)

### Bug Fixes:

A race condition triggered by e.g. multi-part uploads could
render the targeted portion of a file system indefinitely
locked requiring a restart of the proxyfsd daemon. This release
prevents this race condition.

## 1.8.0.5 (November 27, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug that caused proxyfsd to leak "connection slots" from
the ChunkedConnectionPool or the NonChunkedConnectionPool if
the noauth proxy was not running when proxyfs tried to open a
new connection (in swiftclient.acquireChunkedConnection() and
swiftclient.acquireNonChunkedConnection()).  This could happen during
a reload of the noauth proxy when a new configuraiton is pushed.

## 1.8.0.4 (November 12, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug that caused proxyfsd to exit if the SwiftStack controller
deleted a file system using its two step process of first inactivating
it (one reconfig event) and then deleting it (second reconfig event).
In that case, the UnregisterForEvents() would be called twice and it
would call logger.Fatalf() to complain, causing Samba (smbd) to exit
and making the SMB client unhappy.

## 1.8.0.3 (November 9, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug that caused proxyfsd to exit if the noauth proxy server
restarted while file system i/o to Swift was in progress.  In particular
this could happen during a reconfig triggered by a controller config push.

## 1.8.0.2 (October 19, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug in the snapshot code that generated snapshot names that
contained a colon which Windows SMB clients find hard to cope with.

## 1.8.0.1 (October 6, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug introduced in 1.8.0 that triggered a NULL pointer dereference
if an HTTP GET request specified a byte range without an ending offset.


## 1.8.0 (September 30, 2018)

### Features:

Add filesystem snapshots which are created and destroyed based on policies
that are applied to each file system.  Snapshots are accessible via the
newly created "/.snapshot/<snapshot_name>" directory in the root of each
filesystem.

Add bucketized statistics for package swiftclient, fs, and headhunter.
The statistics can be queried via the built-in web server, using
the URL "//localhost:15346:/stats" in runway environments and
"//<private_IPaddr>:1534:/stats" in stand alone environments, where
<private_IPaddr> is the private IP address used for the backend network.

Note: the bucketized statistics API, output format, and URL is unstable
and changing quickly.  It will be different in the next release.

Change config file format (for the *.conf files) so that user defined
names for:
    Volume
    PhysicalContainerLayout
    FlowControl
    Peer
are now preceeded by one of the strings "Volume:",
"PhysicalContainerLayout:", "FlowControl:", or "Peer:", as appropriate,
to insure that names are unique.

Initial work on a "liveness detector" to determine whether
ProxyFS/Samba/NFS are currently up and serving file requests.  This is
part of an HA solution that we are developing.

### Bug Fixes:

Fix a bug that could cause data corruption if a file write sent via
the FUSE or NFS interface failed on the first PUT attempt and had to be
retried, in which case the PUT could be retried with incorrect data for
the file.  This bug was exacerbated by the next bug, which could cause
PUT requests to exceed the 60 sec server timeout deadline.

Fix a bug where "log segments" containing data written to files
were not closed and flushed after the 10 sec deadline (a bug in
inFlightFileInodeDataFlusher() that could extend the PUT request beyond
the Swift server's timeout deadline of 60 sec).

Fix a bug where ProxyFS would either move to a new container for file
log segments too quickly ("MaxObjectsPerContainer" was not being checked
against correctly).

Insure that ProxyFS will not accept requests via the FUSE interface
while its re-reading its configuration (could lead to corruption).

Add additional units tests for sequential writes.

Improvements to the mock Swift testing environment, ramswift, to free
memory when ramswift is restarted within a test.

Update generatedfiles Makefile target to make files that are now
necessary.

Reworked proxyfsd daemon startup logic to avoid possible race conditions
during startup.

Reworked ramswift daemon startup logic to avoid race conditions sometimes
hit when running tests.


### Notes

* With the advent of Golang v1.11, new support for WebAssembly has arrived. To build for a
WebAssembly target, setting GOOS=js and GOARCH=wasm is required. Unfortunately, the arrival
of these two new values ("js" and "wasm"), Go source files ending with _js.go, in particular,
will only be compiled if GOOS=js has been set. Previously (Golang v1.10 and prior), a file
ending in _js.go would always be included. This release captures a name change to various
static files generated in package httpserver by adding an underscore ("_") just before ".go"
to avoid this new Golang behavior.

* Enhance the swiftclient chunked put unit tests to try and cover
concurrency and many more failure/retry scenarios.  Add a new config file
variable in the `SwiftClient` section, `ChecksumChunkedPutChunks`` which
defaults to 'false'.  If set to `true` then data cached in a chunked put
connection has a checksum computed when it is Sent and checked frequently
on subsequent operations.

## 1.7 (September 6, 2018)

### Bug Fixes:

* Fix panic in inode cache discard thread.
* Rework flush logic to fix deadlocks when connections are exhausted.

## 1.6.4 (July 24, 2018)

### Features:

* Added support for configuring the NoAuth Swift Proxy to an IP Address other than a default of (IPv4) localhost (127.0.0.1). Note that in the future, the defaulting to localhost may be removed, so users should take care to specify the NoAuth Swift Proxy IP Address in their configurations in the future.
* Added support for the "delimiter=" option for Swift API GET requests. This, along with the "prefix=" option, enables viewing of the directory hierarchy inside a Container in the same way one would view a file system.
* Added support for SnapShots. These are invoked via the RESTful API exposed by the embedded HTTP Server inside each proxyfsd instance. Note that this API is only reachable via the PrivateIPAddr and performs not authentication/authorization. You can find the new RESTful methods underneath the /Volume/<volumeName> resource (along with FSCK, Scrub, and LayoutMap). Both JSON (textual) and formatted HTML is available.
* Added support for viewing a FileInode's ExtentMap via this same RESTful API underneath the /Volume/<volumeName> resource (adjacent to the above-mentioned SnapShot resource).
* RPC Timeouts from pfs_middleware to proxyfsd have new defaults and are controllable via two distinct parameters optionally specified in the [filter:pfs] section of the proxy-server.conf:

>        rpc_finder_timeout
>            specified in (floating point) seconds
>            defaults to 3.0
>            applies when searching for a proxyfsd instance to ask where a particular Swift Account is being served

>        rpc_timeout
>            specified in (floating point) seconds
>            defaults to 30.0
>            applies to requests to the specific proxyfsd instance serving a particular BiModal Swift Account

### Bug Fixes:

* SMB clients making multiple mounts to the same Samba/ProxyFS instance could encounter all sessions/mounts being closed when requesting any one of them to terminate. This has now been corrected.
* Previously, a cache of Inode structures did not support eviction. As a result, a very large number of Inodes accessed since a ProxyFS instance was started could exhaust memory. To address this, a new background thread discards non-dirty Inodes from the Inode Cache. The behavior of the Inode Cache eviction thread is tuned by:
>          MaxBytesInodeCache - defaults to 10485760 (10MB)
>          InodeCacheEvictInterval - defaults to 1s (disabled if 0s)

### Known Issues:

* As of this version, the metadata format has been updated from V2 to V3 in support of the SnapShot functionality. Unfortunately there is no going back. Once a V2 volume is mounted, it is immediately upgraded to V3 despite not (yet) having any SnapShots declared.

## 1.5.3 (April 3, 2018)

Ignore SIGPIPE, SIGCHLD, and some other signals that were causing
proxyfsd to exit when it shouldn't.

Significant improvements to fsck performance and what it validates.
Fsck now detects and cleans up unreferenced objects in the checkpoint
container.  Fix a bug in fsck that caused sparse files to be flagged
corrupt and deleted.  Complementary to fsck, add "scrub" jobs that
validate the object maps (extent maps) for files.

Fix a bug that caused B+Tree nodes to become quite large, which had
a significant performance impact on large file systems.

Prettify the http pages generated by proxyfs.

## 1.4.1 (March 6, 2018)

Fix a bug in the B+Tree code that caused old objects in the
.__checkpoint__ container to become unreferenced instead of deleted.
