This Vagrantfile will create a 3 node etcd cluster

The nodes are named etcd0, etcd1 and etcd2 and use the private network to
communicate etcd traffic.

The IP address/ports used are:
    etcd0 - http://192.168.60.10:2379
    etcd1 - http://192.168.60.11:2379
    etcd2 - http://192.168.60.12:2379

To verify the state of the cluster do:

    [root@etcd0 vagrant]# etcdctl --endpoints "http://192.168.60.10:2379" member list
    6b2642544c5506a8: name=etcd2 peerURLs=http://192.168.60.12:2380 clientURLs=http://192.168.60.12:2379 isLeader=true
    c3911197772abde4: name=etcd1 peerURLs=http://192.168.60.11:2380 clientURLs=http://192.168.60.11:2379 isLeader=false
    df250120953efe33: name=etcd0 peerURLs=http://192.168.60.10:2380 clientURLs=http://192.168.60.10:2379 isLeader=false

    [root@etcd0 vagrant]# etcdctl --endpoints "http://192.168.60.11:2379" cluster-health
    member 6b2642544c5506a8 is healthy: got healthy result from http://192.168.60.12:2379
    member c3911197772abde4 is healthy: got healthy result from http://192.168.60.11:2379
    member df250120953efe33 is healthy: got healthy result from http://192.168.60.10:2379
    cluster is healthy

NOTE: This vagrant file creates a static configuration file in /etc/etcd/etcd.conf.  We
should review this to see if we want something different.

Dump all keys in etcd:

	# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints "http://192.168.60.11:2379" get --prefix ""

Delete a key named TESTKEY1 in etcd:

	# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints "http://192.168.60.11:2379" del TESTKEY1

NOTE: When running PROTO you must run as "root" since the ifconfig needs root to be able bring
up VIP!!!!!!!
